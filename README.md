THIS WEBSITE IS NOT FULLY OPTIMIZED OR SECURED SINCE THAT WAS NOT THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT.

Esurrit is a small and simple social media website.
You can browse the website as a user or as a guest.
As a guest:
- you can view other people's posts;
As a simple user:
- you can upload posts and delete your own posts;
- you can edit your profile picture and description;
As a power user:
- you can delete other people's posts as well;
- you have access to a conversational page for all the power users (admin)
- *the password for the power users page is 'Copilul1', but it can be changed by altering the code (either way, only users that are marked as admins in  the database, are able to access the page).

There is also a search page that allows any user to search post either by the username or by post content.
