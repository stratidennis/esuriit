            This is a website designed and built by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stratinski-dennis" target="_blank">@Stratinski Dennis</a>. It was built as a faculty project in order to be presented at the Web Development class.
        </p>

            The website's name, Esuriit, comes from latin and it means being hungry. Short story: this name was given because I was hungry when I've projected the website the first time.
